    <h2>It's scooter shop project</h2>
    <h3>Idea of this project is to create bigger project which will show my skills with programming.</h3>
    <p>In the future I would like to <b>convert javascript to typescript</b>. I know basics of typescript but i didn't have enough experience with working with this language so I think it can be precious experience.</p> <p>I would also <b>convert vue into nuxt</b>, because i have experience with this framework and it allows to show html page in source code instead empty html.</p> <p>I think that one of steps will be also <b>adding backend</b>, because in the future I would like to become fullstack developer. I can create backend in node.js using framework express.js, but I would like to learn <b>PHP</b> and create backend in <b>Laravel</b>. I think that for this moment I don't have next steps and this shop will be continously improving.</p>
