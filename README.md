# Scooters-stock

You can check this project at www.scooters.dssoftdev.pl

## Project info

It's project of scooter shop built in vue. Currently it's only frontend project with mocked data, but in future I will create backend for this repository. It will be probably written in node.js with express.js framework or in PHP with any framework, because i would like to learn this programming language.
Project is currently under construction so it doesn't have some features or features can work not properly.

I have some goals (features) that have been added:

- Login / register page
- catalog page with pagination
- scooter page
- basket page with few steps
- user page with possibility of editing user data and checking our favorites scooters or previous orders (it's under construction but some features works)

,some features that doesn't work but they have pages and some ideas for features in my mind or they keep appearing.
